You can sign up for a free account on the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup). The "free" account comes with USD$18 of free credit each month, which will be more than enough for experimental purposes.

## Pricing Model

OpenAI gives each person $18 of credits to use on their APIs each month for free, and you can add your credit card to buy more credits.

Each time you use the API, you pay based on how big your request is. That is, if you send a message with more words or characters, that will cost more than a smaller or shorter message.

The free credit should be more than enough for experimental use. Each request to the API generally costs a few cents.
