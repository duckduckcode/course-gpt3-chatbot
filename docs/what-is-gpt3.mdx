# What is GPT-3?

GPT-3 is a **machine learning model** that was created by a company called **OpenAI**.

The name **GPT-3** stands for **Generative Pre-trained Transformer**, and it's the **3rd** version of this model that OpenAI has released.

Let's break down what is meant by **Generative Pre-trained Transformer**:

- **Generative**: It is designed to generate content (natural language in this case).
- **Pre-trained**: It is trained on content from the Internet.
- **Transformer**: The type of machine learning algorithm used in GPT-3.

The GPT-3 machine learning model is very large, too big to download, so OpenAI hosts GPT-3 on a **web server** for developers to use over the Internet.
