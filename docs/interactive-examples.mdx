# Interactive examples

OpenAI has an **Examples** page on their website, where you can find many **interactive examples** of GPT-3 use cases.

![The Examples page has many GPT-3 examples that can be loaded in the Playground](/tutorial-images/gpt3-examples-page.png)

Exploring these examples will help you better understand what GPT-3 is able to do. When you click an example, it will open in the **Playground**, where you can see all the settings and make changes to see what happens.

Let's look at a couple of specific examples, and use those examples to talk more about how GPT-3 works.

## Essay Outline Generator

The text displayed in the input area is known as the **prompt**. The prompt is the text that gets **sent** to GPT-3 when you click the **Submit** button.

The simplest prompt is just a piece of text that has a command to "do something". In this example, the command is to "Create an outline for an essay".

When you submit a **prompt**, GPT-3 generates a **completion**.

The **completion** is the part shown in **green**.

**Experiments to try:**

- Change **Nikola Tesla** to **Bill Gates**? How does this change the result?
- If you change **technology** to **developing nations** how does that affect the ouput?
- What happens if you reduce the **Maximum length** to **60**?

## Micro Horror Story Creator

The **prompt** can be written so that it gives GPT-3 an idea of what you're expecting it to generate. If you give it a **pattern** to follow, it will continue and complete that pattern.

This example prompt shows a pattern of a **topic** followed by a **two-sentence horror story**.

The prompt **ends** with an empty space for a new horror story to be filled in, following the same pattern.

**Experiments to try:**

- Change the **temperature** slider to zero. What happens?
- Select a different **model**. How does this change the generated text?

## Sarcastic Chatbot

The **prompt** can also combine concepts, like in this example where it defines some **background information** followed by a **pattern to complete**.

This is a common prompt design for writing chatbots, as it allows you to "set the scene" for the bot, and also give it some examples of how you expect it to interact with anyone it talks to.
