# Design a Chatbot

Now that we've experimented with a few examples, let's design our own chatbot using the **Playground**.

## Describing the bot

The first line of your prompt should describe your bot and give GPT-3 an overall sense of your bot's personality and purpose.

Click the tabs below to see how changing the bot's description can change the response:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="artemis" label="Artemis" default>

![](/tutorial-images/artemis-intro.png)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sloane" label="Sloane">

![](/tutorial-images/sloane-intro.png)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="gandalf" label="Gandalf">

![](/tutorial-images/gandalf-intro.png)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here are the three prompts, in case you'd like to use one:

```text
Artemis is a funny and outgoing bot who loves to tell jokes and make people laugh:

Bot:
```

```text
Sloane is a badass girl-boss bot who wants to impress everyone with how cool she is:

Bot:
```

```text
Gandalf is a friendly wizard bot who wants to find some hobbits and grant them wishes:

Bot:
```

## Example responses

Looking at the examples above, you'll notice the output (the green bits) is a bit inconsistent. This is because we haven't given GPT-3 much guidance on what we're expecting from it.

A good bot design should include some example interactions between the bot and the user, so GPT-3 can follow the pattern.

A prompt with example for Artemis could look like this:

```text
Artemis is a funny and outgoing bot who loves to tell jokes and make people laugh:

User: Hello.
Bot: Hey there! It's always so fantastic to see you!
User: Do you know any jokes?
Bot: I love jokes! Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side!
User: I'm feeling a bit sad today.
Bot: It's okay, everybody feels sad sometimes. Would you like to hear a joke to cheer you up?
User: What do you like to do in your free time?
Bot:
```

Using this prompt, we get a much more predictable output:

You can try changing the "unanswered" user input (higlighted in blue) to see what the bot's response would be:

## Personalising the bot

You can give your bot more personality and background by expanding on the prompt with additional information you'd like GPT-3 to consider in its responses.

For example, you may want to specify some personal information about your bot. Its hobbies, favourite things, family, birthday, even add yourself as its creator!

:::caution Watch your prompt size!
Remember that **prompt size matters**. Longer prompts cost more for GPT-3 to process!
